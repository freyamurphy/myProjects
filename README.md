# myProjects

## Java projects
### Battleships – Summer 2017
Grade: A4  
A simple text-based battleships game made with BlueJ. I made this for a summer course which was required for direct entry into second year of university.

## C++ projects
### Assember – November 2017
Grade: A3 overall, although my assembler was given 100%.  
An assignment for Computer Systems 2A. Three other team members wrote a Manchester Baby simulator and I wrote an assembler to work with it.

### Hash Table – November 2017
Grade: A1  
An assignment for Multi-Paradigm Programming and Data Structures. The project includes a program called ngram.cpp which splits an input file into strings of length n, stores them in a hash table, and outputs the frequency of each string in the file.

### Cellular Automaton – October 2017
Grade: A4  
An assignment for Computer Systems 2A. I wrote the majority of this code although another student wrote some of the menus.  
Note: This is written in C++11.

## Bash scripting projects
### Bash Repository – October 2017
Grade: B1  
An assignment for Computer Systems 2A. I wrote the majority of the scripts but another student wrote the script to make backups of files. The software is run by executing the repository_app.sh script.

## Other projects (not in repository)
### Medtronic Hololens Project – December 2017-March 2018
As an extracurricular project I made a mixed reality app for the Microsoft Hololens. The aim of the app was to educate medical students about the knee and I made it using Unity and C#. I was in a team of 7 students, although I was the only one studying computing science. I can't put any of the code online as it is owned by Medtronic but I did make a video of the app which can be found here: https://uod.box.com/s/2ozbkm859ieyebw03g2obwl769lp9p3f

### Network Analysis Project – March 2018
Grade: A1  
Assignment for Algorithm and AI. I worked in a team with 3 other students to analyse aeroplane flight data. I wrote some Python programs to visualise the network graphically and some C++ programs to calcualte average path length for the network.

### C# Windows Forms apps – Febuary-March 2018
Grades: A3 and A4  
As assignments for Computer Systems 2B I wrote a simple memory game and an ATM simulator using threading in Visual Studio.

### C data structures – October 2017
Grades: A1 and A1  
As assigments for Multi-Paradigm Programming and Data Structures I wrote a linked list and double ended queue in C.

### Python game – 2016-2017
Grade: A  
For my Advanced Higher Computing Science project I wrote a Connect 4 game with a computer opponent in Python.
